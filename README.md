# Quest "Spring & JDBC 5: DAO and CRUD"

## Educational exercise from Wild Code School

This quest teaches how to implement all the basic operations for database (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate and **D**elete - **CRUD**) into a single interface
which is called in Data Accass Objects (DAO). 

We are given a database containing characters and schools from Harry Potter's universe. 

The target is to correctly implement a CRUD interface for handling this database.
